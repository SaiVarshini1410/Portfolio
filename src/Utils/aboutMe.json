    "aboutMe" : "I’m Sai Varshini Thupakula, a tech lover to the core — the kind who finds joy in memory leaks, runtime errors, and the glorious eureka of finally tracing that one rogue semicolon. I don’t just learn new technologies — I chase them. With a background in backend systems, cloud deployments, scripting, and full-stack apps, I live at the intersection of “how it works” and “how it could work better.”For me, coding isn't a job. It’s how I think. I'm obsessed with figuring out the why behind systems, tearing through documentation at 2 a.m., rewriting modules that 'just worked' because they could work smarter. Complex? In fact, I look for it — because that’s where I grow. I don’t stop until things make sense, and I never leave a system untouched if I can make it faster, cleaner, or more scalable. And while I may be the “quiet fix-it” person on the team, I never shy away from voicing ideas or mentoring others.The short version? I’m a lifelong learner, a builder by instinct, and someone who’ll probably refactor this very paragraph a few months from now — because that’s just who I am."
