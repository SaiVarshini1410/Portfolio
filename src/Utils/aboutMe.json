    "aboutMe" : "If you've ever rebuilt a working app just to make it great - we'll get along. I'm a Software Engineer who designs resilient services, clean schemas, and UIs that hold up under real traffic. I refactor architectures, shape APIs, and hunt latency with profiling, indexes, caches, and queues. I move data at scale - migrations, schema evolution, rolling upgrades - without waking the pager. I ship end-to-end features and wire in CI/observability so code tells on itself. When it helps, I teach products to learn - experiment, evaluate, deploy, iterate."
